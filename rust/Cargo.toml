# WASM storage (uses Emscripten IDBFS backed by browser IndexedDB)
# WASM implementation uses standard Rust std::fs operations with /terrain_cache mounted as IDBFS
# This provides persistent storage without requiring wasm-bindgen or additional dependencies
# Requires IDBFS mount from JavaScript: FS.mount(IDBFS, { autoPersist: true }, '/terrain_cache')
# See src/db/wasm.rs for full implementation details and JavaScript setup examples
#
# Note: sqlite-wasm-rs is incompatible because it requires wasm32-unknown-unknown target,
# but Godot GDExtension uses wasm32-unknown-emscripten (no wasm-bindgen support)
